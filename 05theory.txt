Data Discretization and Data Visualization

Data Discretization:
Data discretization is the process of converting continuous data into discrete buckets or intervals. This is often done to simplify the analysis and to make patterns in the data more apparent. Discretization can be performed using various methods, such as:

1. **Equal-width binning**: Divides the range of the data into intervals of equal size.
2. **Equal-frequency binning**: Divides the data into intervals that contain approximately the same number of observations.
3. **Clustering-based discretization**: Uses clustering algorithms to group data points into clusters, which are then treated as discrete intervals.
4. **Decision tree-based discretization**: Uses decision tree algorithms to determine the optimal split points for discretizing the data.

Data Visualization:
Data visualization is the graphical representation of data to help people understand and interpret the information more easily. Effective data visualization can reveal trends, patterns, and outliers that might not be apparent in raw data. Common types of data visualizations include:

1. **Bar charts**: Used to compare different categories of data.
2. **Line charts**: Used to show trends over time.
3. **Pie charts**: Used to show the proportions of a whole.
4. **Histograms**: Used to show the distribution of a single variable.
5. **Scatter plots**: Used to show the relationship between two variables.
6. **Heatmaps**: Used to show the intensity of data at different points.

Both data discretization and data visualization are crucial techniques in data analysis, helping to transform raw data into meaningful insights.

Conclusion:
Using WEKA's visualization tool, we could observe how the data points are distributed, allowing for an initiative understanding of the demographic spread.
