# Data Mining

**Data mining** is the process of discovering patterns, correlations, and anomalies within large sets of data with the goal of extracting useful information. It involves various techniques from statistics, machine learning, and database systems to analyze and interpret data.

## Classification

**Classification** is a supervised learning technique used in data mining to categorize data into predefined classes or groups. The algorithm learns from a training dataset with known labels and then assigns labels to new, unseen data. Common algorithms include:

- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

## Clustering

**Clustering** is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points into clusters based on their features. Unlike classification, clustering does not require labeled data. It helps in identifying natural groupings within the data. Popular clustering algorithms include:

- K-Means
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN

## Association Rule

**Association rule mining** is a technique used to find relationships between variables in large datasets. It is commonly used in market basket analysis to identify items that frequently co-occur in transactions. The most well-known algorithm for association rule mining is the **Apriori algorithm**, which identifies frequent itemsets and generates association rules based on support and confidence metrics.

## Conclusion

Using the WEKA tool, we applied key data mining algorithms, such as classification, clustering, and association rule mining, on the preprocessed data. This allowed us to understand how different algorithms work to identify patterns, group data, and make predictions based on input attributes.
